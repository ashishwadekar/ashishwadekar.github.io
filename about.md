**Hello there!**<br><br>
I am **Ashish Wadekar**.<br><br> I am a passionate **Rubyist** and working as **Ruby on Rails developer** at The NextWave Technologies and actively working on flagship project called ProfitBooks. You can have a look at it [here](http://www.profitbooks.net)

Having a formal education as Production Engineer and leaving behind a cosy managerial role in a MNC to dive into the exciting world of development, this blog will share all the things I have learned on the way while traversing the ocean of code.

I am also into a little bit of iPhoneography and share the photos on instagram. Check them out [here](http://www.instagram.com/ashishwadekar)

Do drop me an email on : **ashishawadekar [at] gmail [dot] com** and let's begin a conversation!
